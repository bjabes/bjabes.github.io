Hi there, I'm Boris. I'm an entrepreneur and [angel investor][1] who loves to build software.

I am a proud Canadian who grew up in Paris and now lives in San Francisco.

I previously founded [Meldium][], a [YC-backed][YC] security startup, which was acquired by [LogMeIn][].

I speak about technology and love to help startup founders, so [reach out](mailto:bjabes@gmail.com) ([public key][2]).

I moonlight as an amateur tour guide if you're visiting.

Someday, I hope to recreate the magic of [HyperCard][].
