Hi there, I'm [Boris][profile-photo]. I'm the founder and CEO of [Census][], a service that helps companies sync customer data across business systems.

Previously I founded Meldium, a [YC-backed][YC] password manager for teams, which was acquired by [LogMeIn][].

I love to help other startup founders and sometimes [angel invest][1] so please [reach out][email] ([public key][2]).

I am a proud Canadian who grew up in Paris and now lives in San Francisco. I moonlight as an amateur tour guide if you're visiting.

Someday, I hope to recreate the magic of [HyperCard][].
