Hi there, I'm Boris. I'm the founder and CEO of [Census][], a service that helps companies sync customer data across business systems.

Previously I founded Meldium, a [YC-backed][YC] password manager for teams, which was acquired by [LogMeIn][].

I enjoy speaking about technology, helping other startup founders, and [angel investing][1].

I grew up in Canada & France before eventually moving to the US. Before settling in San Francisco, I lived in Seattle & Pittsburgh. I moonlight as an amateur tour guide if you're visiting.

Someday, I hope to recreate the magic of [HyperCard][].
