Hi there, I'm Boris. I'm an entrepreneur and [angel investor][1] who runs [Polynome][], a tech consultancy.

I am a proud Canadian who grew up in Paris and now lives in San Francisco.

I founded [Meldium][], a [YC-backed][YC] security startup, which was acquired by [LogMeIn][].

I enjoy speaking about technology and love to help startup founders, so please [reach out][email] ([public key][2]).

I moonlight as an amateur tour guide if you're visiting.

Someday, I hope to recreate the magic of [HyperCard][].
